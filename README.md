# Vital-Flow-Connect
Blood, an irreplaceable entity sourced only from humans, is crucial for sustaining healthcare services. Ensuring the timely availability of quality blood is paramount. National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) and National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare Providers (NABH) guidelines underscore the importance of maintaining blood quality and identifying Professional Donors. However, manual monitoring and donor identification pose significant challenges. Our work represents a standardized Blood Bank Management System with an innovative rule-based enforcement mechanism, designed to streamline operations and adhere to medical standards. The system offers an end-to-end solution for management, enforcement strategies, and decision support. By combining rule-based enforcement mechanisms with a computerized central blood bank management system, this project addresses the limitations of manual systems. Utilizing the available software like MySQL, PHP, and barcode technology in a web-based platform, VITALFLOW manages donor records, monitors blood screening, and ensures secure medical reports. The implementation of "VitalFlow Connect" not only enhances the efficiency of the process but also contributes to solve errors in manual systems, reducing time consumption, and improving data retrieval.
